+++++++++++++++++++The program function and the sample input below+++++++++++++++++++
1.O invertible matrix,matters need attention:
O invertible matrix only need to input a matrix, the input sample
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
Pay attention to the adjacent two Numbers separated by a space
2.Matrix of the dot product, need to enter two matrix,
 input matrix method as well as the middle with the capital of the 'X', input sample：
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
X
1 2 3
1 2 3
1 2 3
3.Multiple solutions of a type, in the process, you just need to the unknown coefficient (signed) equals sign and add and subtract Numbers do not need to write, output sample：
If you want to askX+Y=0,3X+2Y=9,so the input
1 1 0
3 2 9
Adjacent Numbers separated by a space
4.Transposed matrix
The input and invertible matrix input is the same
5.For matrix and matrix the dot product of the same knowledge could become a '+' to 'X'
6.Matrix multiplication'
    2 as input and function
7.The square of matrix'
    1 as input and function
8.Strives for the eigenvalues of the matrix'
    1 as input and function
9.Strives for the featurevector of the matrix'
    1 as input and function
